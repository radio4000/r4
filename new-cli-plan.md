R4(1)                     User Commands                    R4(1)

NAME
       r4 - Radio4000 command-line interface

SYNOPSIS
       r4 <noun> <verb> [<args>] [flags]

DESCRIPTION
       Manage Radio4000 channels and tracks from the command line.
       All data is normalized through a zod schema. Commands output
       JSON by default and can generate SQL for SQLite imports.

   Data Sources
       Read operations (list/view) use smart fallback:
       1. Query v2 API (Supabase)
       2. Fall back to bundled v1 data (read-only, ~600 channels)

       Write operations (create/update/delete) only work with v2.
       Attempting to modify v1 channels returns an error.
